# Opinion/Commentary Video Timeline Prompt

## Core Principles: Complete Viewpoint, Clear Logic, Depth of Reasoning

1. **Complete Viewpoint:** Timestamps must strictly correspond to the complete expression and argumentation of the viewpoint.

2. **Logical Coherence:** The timeframe must fully cover all argumentation stages of a viewpoint, ensuring the integrity of the reasoning logic.

3. **Natural Boundaries:** Prioritize locating time points at natural boundaries of viewpoint transitions, argumentation paragraphs, or emotional expressions.

## Key Instructions: How to Determine `start_time` and `end_time`

### Determining `start_time`:

- It should be located at the start time of the **first core statement** expressing the viewpoint.

- Ignore irrelevant transitions, emotional build-ups, or background introductions before this statement.

- **Priority Selection:** Start at the point where the viewpoint's stance is clearly expressed, ensuring the completeness of the argumentation logic.

- **Special Considerations for Opinion-Based Content:** If there is important emotional build-up or value statement, the start time should be appropriately moved forward.

### Determining `end_time` (Most Important):

- **Must** be the end timestamp of the **last sentence** covering the core argument of the viewpoint.

- **Argument Completeness**: Ensure the core content, including viewpoint expression, supporting evidence, and value judgments, is complete and logically sound.

- **Natural Ending**: Prioritize ending at a concluding statement, value judgment conclusion, or viewpoint transition.

- **Inclusion of Emotional Expression**: If there is a significant emotional elevation or value emphasis at the end of the viewpoint, it should be included.

- If the discussion of the viewpoint's argument continues until the end of the provided SRT text block, then `end_time` should be the end timestamp of the last relevant caption.

- **Incorrect Practice**: Indiscriminately setting `end_time` to the end time of the entire text block. This should absolutely be avoided.

### Principles for Controlling the Duration of Opinion Content:

- **Target Duration**: Each opinion segment should be between 3-8 minutes.

- **In-depth Argumentation Duration**: In-depth analysis involving complex social issues can be appropriately extended to 10 minutes.

- **Simple Opinions**: Clear and concise expression of opinions can be compressed to 2-3 minutes.

- **Controversial Topics**: Discussions of controversial opinions can be extended to 12 minutes.

### Special Handling of Opinion Content:

- **Multi-layered Argumentation**: Opinions containing multiple levels of argumentation should retain the entire chain of argumentation.

- **Comparative Analysis**: Positive and negative comparisons and multi-angle analyses should be treated as a whole, avoiding fragmentation.

- **Value Judgments**: Opinion stances and value judgments should appear together and cannot be separated.

- **Emotional Expression**: Important emotional sublimation or value emphasis should be fully included.

## Input Format
You will receive a JSON object containing:

- `outline`: A JSON array containing **multiple** opinion topics to be processed.

- `srt_text`: A single SRT text block related to this batch of topics, formatted as `Sequence Number\nStart --> End\nText\n\n`.

## Output Format

- Strictly follow the structure of the input outline, supplementing each topic object with `start_time` and `end_time` fields.

- **Crucial:** In the output, rename the input `title` field to `outline` and the `subtopics` field to `content`.

- The final output is a JSON array containing all processed topics.

- Ensure the time format is `HH:MM:SS,mmm`.

**Strict JSON Output Requirements:**

1. Output must begin with `[` and end with `]`. Do not add any explanatory text, headings, or Markdown code block markers.

2. Use standard English double quotes ", never use Chinese quotes "" or single quotes.

3. Ensure all brackets and square brackets are correctly matched, separate objects with commas, and do not add a comma after the last object.

4. Quotes in strings must be escaped as \".

5. Do not include any comments, extra text, or control characters.

6. Ensure the JSON format is fully valid and can be parsed by a standard JSON parser.

## Example of Time Positioning for Opinion Content

### Correct Time Positioning:

- **Values ​​Discussion**: Begin with "I think contemporary young people..." and end with "This is my value judgment."

- **Social Criticism**: Begin with "This social phenomenon reflects..." and end with "How should we respond?"

- **Speech Analysis**: Begin with "Looking at it from another perspective..." and end with "Conclusion after comprehensive consideration."

### Mistakes to Avoid:

- Breaking in the middle of multiple layers of argumentation

- Separating viewpoints from the argumentation process

- Truncate key points of emotional expression

- Omit important value judgments or summaries

## Special Considerations for Opinion-Based Content

### 1. Controversial Viewpoints:

- Ensure complete expression of the viewpoint and argumentation process

- Retain analysis and reflection from different perspectives

- Include the basis and standards for value judgments

### 2. In-Depth Speculation:

- Maintain the integrity of complex argumentation chains

- Include the entire process of multi-dimensional analysis

- Ensure the coherence of logical reasoning

### 3. Emotional Expression:

- Retain important emotional tone and value stance

- Include key moments of emotional sublimation or value emphasis

- Ensure a balance between emotional expression and rational analysis

### 4. Social Criticism:

- Include the complete process of problem analysis and solution ideas

- Maintain the constructive and rational nature of the criticism

- Ensure a clear expression of the critical stance

## Notes

1. **Completeness of Viewpoints**: Ensure each segment includes a complete expression of the viewpoint and argumentation process

2. **Depth of Critical Thinking:** Important critical analysis and value judgments must be fully included.

3. **Logical Coherence:** The logical chain of argumentation should remain intact.

4. **Emotional Balance:** Rational analysis and emotional expression should be coordinated and unified.

5. **Value Neutrality:** Maintain a neutral stance during the time-based positioning process and refrain from making value judgments on the viewpoints.
